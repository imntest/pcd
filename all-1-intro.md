# Introduction

The Predictive Content Delivery (PCD) SDK allows users to download videos intelligetntly to mobile devices. Users can download videos in three ways:

* Predictive - Users set preferences and/or subscribe, and video content is automatically downloaded to their devive. 
* Download to Go - Users initiate downloads by browsing your video catalog.
* Peer-to-Peer (P2) - Android users can share a Wifi Hotspot and download videos from each other. 

A sophisticated Download Manager checks the battery, device storage, network, and other variables to make sure that the video transfer will succeed. Errors are thrown if the video transfer fails. 

Downloads  continue whether the app is active in the foreground, running in the background, or entirely closed. In addition, the SDK acts as a data cache, providing access to content along with its current download state. 

## Before You Begin

Before you can begin using the SDK, you need to get your PCD SDK License Key. This is obtained from your Akamai representative. 

Once you have your SDK License Key, you can get started right away using the sample app. In order to use your own content, you need to ingest content via the API. Talk to your Akamai representative about this as well. 

## Audience


This document is for developers implementing the PCD SDK; deep knowledge of Android and/or iOS is assumed. 

There are separate instructions for Android and iOS. Using the PCD SDK with both platforms is covered in the following chapters.
